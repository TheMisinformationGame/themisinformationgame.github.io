<p style="text-align: justify">
    The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
    people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
    this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
    research participants. Participants will be shown either a feed of
    social media posts, or a single social media post at a time, and
    they may then react to the post and its comments. The Misinformation
    Game has been designed to be highly customisable so that tightly
    controlled experiences can be created for participants. This
    customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game,
    to facilitate the research of a wide array of social media
    related questions.

## Example Results
{:#example-results}

If you would like to view an example of the results that can be
gathered when using The Misinformation Game, the results of a user
experience study are available from
[the example results page](/link/ExampleResults). Additional
information about the results that are made available for your
analysis are described in the [Results Documentation](/Results).
The results that are recorded for your study will depend upon the
configuration of your study.



## Getting Started
{:#getting-started}

The number of configuration options that are available for the Misinformation
Game may be intimidating. Therefore, if you are new to the tool, or you want
to get a refresher, we recommend that you read our
[Getting Started Guide](/GettingStarted). This guide is a great place to learn
the most important concepts for using the Misinformation Game effectively
for your research.

The paper
[The (Mis)Information Game: A Social Media Simulator](https://psyarxiv.com/628wc/)
also provides an in-depth introduction to the Misinformation Game, alongside
results from two validation studies that were conducted to test it. If you use
the Misinformation Game for your research, we would really appreciate it if
