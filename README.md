# Misinformation Game Documentation
This directory contains several documents outlining the
way that The Misinformation Game works, and how it can
be used to conduct studies.

### How to play The Misinformation Game
A guide on how to participate in a study that is
being run using The Misinformation Game is described
in the [HowToPlay.md](HowToPlay.md) document. This
page is adapted from the rules that participants
will actually be shown.

### Installation
A guide on how to deploy your own instance of The
Misinformation Game at your own custom URL is
described in the [Installation.md](Installation.md)
document. At the end of this guide, you will have
your own website hosted at your own custom URL,
(e.g. https://misinformation-game.web.app).

A walk-through of this guide that assumes less
technical knowledge, but which may take longer
for technical users, is also available in the
[Installation_Walkthrough.pdf](Installation_Walkthrough.pdf)
document.

### Updating your Installation
A guide on how to update your own instance of The
Misinformation Game to the newest version available
can be found in the [Updating.md](Updating.md)
document.

### Firebase Pricing
Firebase offers a generous free tier for Firebase,
however for studies with many images or many participants,
this free tier may be exceeded. More information on
the limits to the free tier, and the cost of hosting the
website into the paid tier, can be found in the
[FirebasePricing.md](FirebasePricing.md) document.

### Registering Administrators
A guide on registering administrators, and a description
of their privileges, can be found in the
[Administrators.md](Administrators.md) document. Users
without administrator privileges will not be able to
create new studies.

### Study Configuration
The method of creating studies is described in the
[StudyConfiguration.md](StudyConfiguration.md) document.
The guide explains how to copy the template to start
creating a new study, a description of all the settings
contained within the configuration spreadsheet, and
a guide on how to upload your study to your deployment
of The Misinformation Game.

### Managing Studies
After you have created and uploaded your studies to
The Misinformation Game, you will also have to access
the study to enable it, download its results, or even
to delete it. The processes to perform each of these
tasks is described in the
[ManagingStudies.md](ManagingStudies.md) document.

### Simulation
A description of the simulation that the participants
interact with is described in the
[Simulation.md](Simulation.md) document. This document
includes a description of how the credibility and
followers of sources and participants changes throughout
games, as well as an in-depth description of how the
sources and posts are chosen to show to the participant.

### Results
The results that are generated after participants have
interacted with a study are described in the
[Results.md](Results.md) document. This document
describes what each value in the results represents,
how they were recorded, and how they may be
used in analysis.

### Development Environment
Setting up the development environment to work on The
Misinformation Game is described in the
[Development.md](Development.md) document. If you wish
to program new features into The Misinformation Game,
this is the best place to start.

### Technical Overview
An overview of the technical considerations that were
made to create The Misinformation Game are described
in the [TechnicalOverview.md](TechnicalOverview.md)
document. This includes an overview of the different
technologies that are used in the project, as well as
a diagram showing the main data-flows within the application.

### Original Design
The original design that was made before The Misinformation
Game was developed can be found in
[original-design/README.md](original-design/README.md).
This design is not representative of the current state of
the application, however it was the starting point for
this whole project and is therefore kept for posterity.
