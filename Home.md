<p style="text-align: justify">
    The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
    people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
    this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
    research participants. Participants will be shown either a feed of
    social media posts, or a single social media post at a time, and
    they may then react to the post and its comments. The Misinformation
    Game has been designed to be highly customisable so that tightly
    controlled experiences can be created for participants. This
    customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game,
    to facilitate the research of a wide array of social media
    related questions.
