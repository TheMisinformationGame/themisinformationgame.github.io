# The Misinformation Game

The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to
study the behavior of people when they interact with social
media. To achieve this, The Misinformation Game simulates
a social media feed for research participants. Participants
will be shown one fake social media post at a time. They may
then react to the post and its comments. The posts, the sources
of those posts, and the comments underneath the posts that are
shown to participants are all configurable though the
[configuration spreadsheet](StudyConfiguration.md).

Additionally, participants may have a follower count and
credibility rating that will be tracked throughout their
game. These values will change throughout the game as the
interactions of participants with posts affect their follower
count and credibility rating. The changes to a participant's
follower count and credibility rating after they interact
with posts can be controlled through the configuration
spreadsheet.


### Example Game

## Getting Started
The Misinformation Game is primarily a research tool.
Therefore, it contains many configuration options to
tailor the game for specific research purposes. To find
out whether The Misinformation Game is the right fit for
your research, you may see the options for configuring
your own study in the
[study configuration documentation](StudyConfiguration.md).
Additionally, the results that are made available
for analysis are also described in the
[results documentation](Results.md).

Once you have decided to create and run a study using
The Misinformation Game, you will need to host your
own website for the game. The steps to host your own
instance of the game are described in both a
[Non-Technical Installation Guide](NonTechnicalInstallation.pdf)
and a [Technical Installation Guide](TechnicalInstallation.md).
If you are proficient with the command-line and
installing technical tools, then the technical
installation guide will be quicker, and requires fewer
steps. However, if you are not familiar with these
technologies, then the non-technical installation
guide should be easier to follow.
