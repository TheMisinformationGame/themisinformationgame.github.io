## How to Participate

### Posts
You will be shown a series of posts, which you are encouraged

  others that you dislike the content of this post.

- The **share** button (rightwards-facing arrow) will show
  this post to your followers.

- The **flag** button (flag icon) will report this post as

  the post at all.

To move on to the next post, you must first select to like,

_Note: You may not be shown all of these reactions. This 
is normal and depends on what reactions have been enabled._

### Comments
