# The Misinformation Game

The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to
study people's behaviour when they interact with social media.
To achieve this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social
media feed for research participants. Participants will be shown
one fake social media post at a time, and they may then react to
the post and its comments. The Misinformation Game has been
designed to be highly customisable so that tightly controlled
experiences can be created for participants. This customisability
is a core focus of The Misinformation Game, to facilitate the
research of a wide array of social media related questions.

## Getting Started
The Misinformation Game contains many configuration options
to tailor the game for specific research purposes. To find
out whether The Misinformation Game is the right fit for
your research, we recommend that you read through the available
options for configuring your own study on the
[Study Configuration](StudyConfiguration.md) page. Additionally,
the results that are made available for your analysis are
described on the [Results](Results.md) page.

To conduct a study using The Misinformation Game, you will need
to host your own website for the game using Google Firebase.
The steps to host your own instance of the game are described in both a
[Non-Technical Installation Guide](NonTechnicalInstallation.pdf)
and a [Technical Installation Guide](TechnicalInstallation.md).
If you are proficient with the command-line and
installing technical tools, then the technical
installation guide will be quicker, and requires fewer
steps. However, if you are not familiar with these
technologies, then the non-technical installation
guide should be easier to follow.
