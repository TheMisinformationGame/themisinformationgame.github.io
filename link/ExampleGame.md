# Example Games
{:#intro .no_toc}

These example games may be used to help to understand the basic functionality
and purpose of The Misinformation Game. The study configuration spreadsheets
that were used to create the example games can be found [here](/link/ExampleStudy).

<p class="info">
    If the game doesn't load correctly for you, then that may be caused due
    to hosting limits. The example game is hosted under the free tier of
    Firebase. You can read more about Firebase's limits and pricing in
    the <a href="/FirebasePricing">Firebase Pricing Documentation</a>.
