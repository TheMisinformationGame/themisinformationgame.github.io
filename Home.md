The Misinformation Game is a
[free and open-source](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame)
social-media simulator
built to study how people interact with information on social-media. To
achieve this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social-media feed for
research participants. Participants are shown fake social-media posts,
either one at a time or in a feed format. Participants may then react to the
posts and their comments. The Misinformation Game has been designed to
be highly customisable so that a broad range of tightly controlled
experiences can be created for participants. This customisability is
a core focus of The Misinformation Game, to facilitate the research of
a wide array of social-media related questions.

## What is Recorded?
{:#example-results}

The Misinformation Game records a wealth of information about how each
participant acts within studies. If you would like to view example results
that were recorded, we provide results from a user experience study on
[the example results page](/link/ExampleResults).
Additionally, all information recorded by The Misinformation Game
is described in detail in [the Results documentation](/Results). The results
that are recorded for your study will depend upon how your study
is configured.

## Getting Started ðŸš€
{:#getting-started}

If you are new to the tool, or you would like a refresher on its use, we recommend
that you read our [Getting Started Guide](/GettingStarted). This guide is a great
place to learn the most important concepts for using The Misinformation Game
effectively for your research.

The paper
[The (Mis)Information Game: A Social Media Simulator](https://psyarxiv.com/628wc/)
also provides an in-depth introduction to the Misinformation Game, alongside
results from two validation studies that were conducted to test it. If you use
The Misinformation Game for your research, we would really appreciate it if
you [cited this paper](#cite)!
