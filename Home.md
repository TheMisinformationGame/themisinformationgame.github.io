    The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
    people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
    this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
    research participants. Participants will be shown either a feed of
    social media posts, or a single social media post at a time, and
    they may then react to the post and its comments. The Misinformation
    Game has been designed to be highly customisable so that tightly
    controlled experiences can be created for participants. This
    customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game,
    to facilitate the research of a wide array of social media
    related questions.

## Getting Started
{:#getting-started}

The Misinformation Game contains many configuration options
to tailor the game for specific research purposes. To find
out whether The Misinformation Game is the right fit for
your research, we recommend that you first read through the
[How to Play](/HowToPlay) page and try the
[Example Game](#example-game). We then advise that you read
the available options for configuring your own study on the
[Study Configuration](/StudyConfiguration) page. Additionally,
the results that are made available for your analysis are
described on the [Results](/Results) page.

To conduct a study using The Misinformation Game, you will
need to host your own website for the game. Your options to
host your own instance of the game are described on the
[Installation](/Installation) page.
