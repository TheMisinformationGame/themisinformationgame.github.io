# Example Games
{:#intro .no_toc}

We have provided these example games in the hopes that they may help you to
understand the basic functionality and purpose of The Misinformation Game.
There are two example games that are provided here. One uses the single-post
mode, and the other uses the feed mode of the Misinformation Game. The
single-post mode will display a single post to you at a time, whereas the
feed mode will display all posts in a feed. The former can be useful if
you wish for all your participants to consider one post at a time,
whereas the latter is closer to real social-media platforms. We hope you
enjoy playing through these games!

Additionally, the study configuration spreadsheets that were used to
create the example games can be found [here](/link/ExampleStudy).
You may use these as examples when building your own study using the
Misinformation Game.

    If the game doesn't load correctly for you, then that may be caused due
    to hosting limits. The example games are hosted under the free tier of
