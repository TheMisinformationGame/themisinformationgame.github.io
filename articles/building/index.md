In this roller-coaster ride of an article, brace yourself for a hard-hitting trifecta of
misinformation, an audacious quest of students engineering a research tool, and the
unlikely hero of the tale â€“ good ol' Google Sheets.

If you've surfed the internet, chances are that you have swallowed a dose of misinformation
or two. It is so common, and so widespread, that misinformation will find you even if all
you view online is cooking recipes, cute puppies, and Irish dancing videos. Therefore, to
combat the misinformation, we have all developed robust BS detectors to filter out the crap.
However, regrettably, our BS detectors often have bugs, and I know personally I still have
to catch myself every now and then.

* Did I fall for the urban legend of spiders climbing into people's mouths while they sleep? Yes.
* Did I think American Vandal was real? This one was so obvious, and yet, also _yes_... (Only for a brief time, I swear.)
* <span>
    <span class="striked">Did I believe AI would subjugate humanity? Thankfully, I didn't fall for that one.</span>
    <span>(Let's be real, the will-they won't-they is what keeps it interesting!)</span>
</span>

**Unfortunately, it is unlikely that misinformation is going anywhere any time soon, even with AI to help.** Therefore,
in order to maintain public health, uphold the integrity of our political systems, and prevent radicalism, we must
research how misinformation spreads and how we can combat it. This is a _really hard_ problem.

Thankfully, our group of 3rd and 4th-year university students weren't tasked with fighting misinformation, but
instead we were tasked with developing a tool that the experts can use to research how to fight misinformation.
With this goal in mind, we set out on our quest to develop [The Misinformation Game](/)!

## So... what is it?

The Misinformation Game is a [free and open-source](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame) social-media simulator
to help run controlled social-media experiments. In short, it lets researchers set up social-media feeds where they made all
the posts, so that they can observe how participants interact with them. If you'd like to try it out, we have a
[live demo](/link/ExampleGame) that you can try!

The development of this project involved making one tech decision in particular that is quite unorthodox. Therefore,
I thought it would be interesting to write this article to explore that decision, and how it went!

## The Stack ðŸ¥ž

The Misinformation Game was built using Firebase, Tailwind, React, and _Google Sheets_ (yes, you read that right!).
The first three, Firebase, Tailwind, and React, are all pretty standard choices. They have a free tier, are quick,
and are good for UI, respectively.

However, if you're a software engineer reading through this post, your eyebrows might have just hit the ceiling
at the mention of _choosing_ to put spreadsheets in a tech stack. Stories from my friends and lecturers who've had
the, ahem, pleasure of wrestling with Excel databases or yanking companies out of the suffocating clutches of Excel sheets,
make the nightmares that spreadsheets can cause pretty clear.

But, let me just say, _I think using Google Sheets for this project was one of the best tech choices we made_.

<figure id="study_config">
    <img src="/diagrams/study-configuration-header.png" alt="Screenshot of a configuration for a study in Google Sheets." height="513" />

## Google Sheets, huh, yeah. What is it good for?

_Absolutely everything!_

Well, not everything. Actually, **configuration!**

All configuration for studies in the Misinformation Game is done in big spreadsheets on Google Sheets.
These spreadsheets may then be downloaded from Google Sheets and uploaded to The Misinformation Game
for presentation to research participants.

<div class="quote">
    You: That seems overcomplicated...
</div>

Maybe, but let me tell you about all of Google Sheets' quirks and features!

* **_Images in the Config._** Social-media is full of images. Therefore, it was crucial that our platform had
  to support them as well. Google Sheets allows users to easily place images right into spreadsheet cells.
  This makes it really easy and intuitive to add post and avatar images right in your config!

<figure id="images_in_config">
    <img style="height: 180px" src="images_in_config.png" alt="Images used within the configuration." height="333" />
</figure>

* **_Built-In Rich Text Editor._** It is very common that research studies need to present pages of instructions
  to their participants before they start the study and after they finish it. Text formatting is very desirable for
  these pages, and Google Sheets has it built-in! We just need to do a simple conversion of their rich text to HTML.

<figure id="rich_text">
    <img style="height: 160px" src="rich_text.png" alt="An example of formatted text in the config." height="302" />
</figure>

* **_Live Error Checking._** The bread and butter of spreadsheets is updating cells based on the values of other
  cells. We can use this to provide live error-checking of all values that researchers enter into their
  spreadsheets. This reduces a lot of friction when setting up studies using the Misinformation Game.

<figure id="live_error_checking">
    <img style="height: 140px" src="live_error_checking.png" alt="A row showing an error in a config." height="271" />
</figure>

* **_UX for Free._** Researchers understand spreadsheets! The user experience of navigating and entering information
  into a spreadsheet is familiar territory. To me, this is the biggest advantage, as we didn't have to worry about
  nearly as many user-experience headaches when building our backend user interface.


## Google Sheets for All Configuration! ðŸŒˆ

So you're saying, we can **_just use spreadsheets_** instead of configuration files or bespoke configuration user interfaces!

Nope! No. No no no!

Whilst spreadsheets were great for our project, they're definitely not all sunshine and rainbows! ðŸŒˆ They have several
significant drawbacks.

## The Downsides ðŸ˜¬

Google Sheets may have reduced the time required to develop our tool, but it has also led to _significant maintenance
and update overheads_. So, while our tool is more feature-rich and robust thanks to Google Sheets, **_keeping it that
way may be difficult_**.

* **_Google Sheets will Change._** Our documentation is all based upon a snapshot of Google Sheets at one point in time.
  It is very likely that Google Sheets will change in the future, and with those changes, our documentation will become
  outdated. This is acceptable for a research tool that may not live for more than a few years, but it is definitely
  undesirable for larger commerical pieces of software.

* **_We can't update people's configurations in-place._** If we make changes to our spreadsheet template,
  users must manually copy their configuration to the new template. This makes small updates to the configuration
  spreadsheet much more costly, and it destroys any thought of live updates and bugfixes for the configuration.

* **_We can't add our own bespoke features._** There are several features, such as live previews, that are simply not
  possible when using this configuration system. While we use spreadsheets, there will always be friction when users must
  download their spreadsheets to upload them into the Misinformation Game, where we can provide those features.

## The Wise Man's Use of Spreadsheets ðŸ¦‰

Sure, spreadsheets have their fare share of hurdles. We don't control the hosting of Google Sheets,
it's difficult to update people's configurations, and it makes it hard for us to add bespoke features.

But guess what? Sometimes the path that gets a few side-eyes and raised brows is the one that gives
you the edge. Google Sheets, for all its quirks, allowed us to make our project more feature-rich
and robust under the limited time and budget that we had available.

And let's face it, in a world where misinformation is as easy to spread as a cute puppy video, we need all the help we can get.
And if that help comes in the form of a spreadsheet... well, bring it on.

## Final Thoughts

So, there you have it, folks. I probably won't be using Google Sheets for any future projects any time soon,
but I'm sure glad we had it in the arsenal for this one. If you're interested to learn more about the Misinformation
Game, we have written extensive documentation for it on [this very website](/) (it's more serious than this post,
I promise). We also have a preprint paper available [on PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/628wc/), and hopefully the
full peer-reviewed version will be available soon.

This is the first software article that I've written, but I hope to write more. If you'd like to find out about
those when I do, you can find me (Padraig Lamont) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paddy_lamont) or
